## 📌 Problem Statement

Insurance companies process thousands of damage claims every day.

Traditional claim verification requires human reviewers to:

* Inspect uploaded evidence
* Understand customer claims
* Compare visual and textual information
* Detect inconsistencies
* Assess fraud risk

This process is:

* ⏳ Time-consuming
* 💰 Expensive
* 📈 Difficult to scale
* 🚨 Vulnerable to fraudulent claims

The objective of this project is to automate claim verification using an Agentic AI pipeline capable of reasoning across both text and images.

---

## 🏗️ Solution Overview

The system is designed as a multi-agent architecture where each agent performs a specialized task.

### Workflow

```text
User Claim
      ↓
Claim Agent
      ↓
Vision Agent
      ↓
Evidence Agent
      ↓
Risk Agent
      ↓
Decision Agent
      ↓
Confidence Scoring
      ↓
Fraud Scoring
      ↓
Final Verdict
```

The final verdict is generated using both textual and visual evidence.

## 🤖 AI Agents

### 1️⃣ Claim Agent

Extracts structured damage information from natural language claims.

**Input**

```text
My car door got dented after an accident.
```

**Output**

```json
{
  "issue_type": "dent",
  "object_part": "door"
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Vision Agent

Analyzes uploaded images using Gemini Vision.

Extracts:

* Damage type
* Damaged object part
* Severity
* Image validity
* Damage visibility

---

### 3️⃣ Evidence Agent

Evaluates whether the uploaded evidence sufficiently supports the claim.

Checks:

* Damage visibility
* Image validity
* Evidence consistency

---

### 4️⃣ Risk Agent

Identifies suspicious patterns and risk indicators.

Examples:

* Ambiguous claims
* High-risk wording
* Missing evidence
* Manual review triggers

---

### 5️⃣ Decision Agent

Produces one of the following outcomes:

| Verdict                | Description                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Supported              | Claim aligns with visual evidence |
| Contradicted           | Claim conflicts with evidence     |
| Not Enough Information | Evidence is insufficient          |

---

## 🧠 Semantic Damage Matching

The system performs semantic reasoning instead of strict keyword matching.

Examples:

```text
dent ≈ deformation
broken_part ≈ missing_part
glass_shatter ≈ crack
```

This improves robustness when claim descriptions and visual outputs use different terminology.
